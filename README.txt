This is a React/Node application, to run it you need to run command "npm start" or "yarn start" inside of the JSF (frontend) and ducanAPI (backend) maps seperately. 
NOTE: Not all the features may work because the code needed to run them may have been removed due to it being a sensitive type of data.
